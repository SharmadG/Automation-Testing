These are a few automation testing projects I've developed as part of practicing automation testing with the Java Selenium framework. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Please check src > test/java for the automation testing scripts.

You can directly use my pom.xml for executing any of my automation test script in your personal system.
